"""
Pattern Priority Module - Async PostgreSQL-based priority management.

Ported from Coinswarm-1/local-utilities with improvements:
- Async-first using SQLAlchemy async sessions
- Integrated with Fast_Swarm Database module
- No external dependencies (psycopg2 directly) - uses existing session factory
- Cleaner type hints and error handling

Priority Selection Logic:
  HIGH (0): Fast-tracked for validation
    - Academic patterns: until 100 runs
    - AI-generated patterns: until 50 runs
    - User-specified HIGH: until 300 runs

  NORMAL (1): Active backtesting
    - 30% lowest runs (need more data)
    - 20% lowest fitness (might improve)
    - 50% highest fitness (proven winners)

  LOW (2): Deprioritized (still tested, just later)
    - Patterns with 300+ periods tested (unless top fitness)
