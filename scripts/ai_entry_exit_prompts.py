INDICATOR_KNOWLEDGE = """## TECHNICAL INDICATOR REFERENCE

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
Measures the ratio of recent upward price movements to total price movement.
Range: 0-100
- 0-25: EXTREMELY oversold - sellers exhausted, strong bounce probability
- 25-30: Oversold - selling pressure dominated, potential reversal zone
- 30-70: Neutral - neither buyers nor sellers dominating
- 70-75: Overbought - buying pressure dominated, potential pullback zone
- 75-100: EXTREMELY overbought - buyers exhausted, correction likely

### Stochastic K
Measures where price closed relative to its recent high-low range.
Range: 0-100
- Stoch = 100: Price closed at the HIGH of recent range
- Stoch = 50: Price closed in the MIDDLE of recent range
- Stoch = 20: Price closed near the BOTTOM (20%) of range - oversold
- Stoch = 10: Price at bottom 10% of range - VERY oversold
- Stoch < 5: Price essentially at the FLOOR - EXTREMELY oversold, rare

CRITICAL: Stoch < 10 means price has collapsed to near the lowest point.
This is often a capitulation/exhaustion signal, not just "oversold."

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- MACD Line > 0: Short-term average above long-term (recent prices higher)
- MACD Line < 0: Short-term average below long-term (recent prices lower)
- MACD > Signal: Momentum accelerating upward (positive crossover)
- MACD < Signal: Momentum accelerating downward (negative crossover)

IMPORTANT: Negative MACD during oversold conditions explains WHY price fell.
It is not an additional reason to avoid - the selling already happened.

### ADX (Average Directional Index)
Measures trend STRENGTH, NOT direction. ADX does not tell you up or down.
- 0-20: Weak or absent trend - ranging/choppy market
- 20-40: Moderate trend strength
- 40-60: Strong trend
- 60+: Very strong trend (rare)

CRITICAL: Low ADX (< 20) means RANGING market where mean reversion works well.
Oversold + Low ADX = HIGH probability of bounce back to mean.

### Supertrend
Trend direction indicator using ATR-based dynamic bands.
- Direction = +1: Trend UP
- Direction = -1: Trend DOWN
- Direction = 0: Neutral/undefined

IMPORTANT: Downward Supertrend during oversold shows the TREND that caused the oversold state.
It explains context, not an additional negative signal.

---

## INDICATOR COMBINATIONS (CRITICAL)

### Oversold Combinations (GOOD for longs)
- RSI < 30 + Stoch < 20 = Double oversold, strong reversal signal
- RSI < 25 + Stoch < 10 = EXTREME oversold / capitulation, very high bounce probability
- Stoch < 5 alone = Price at the floor, sellers completely exhausted

### Oversold + Trend Context
- Oversold + ADX < 20 = Dip in ranging market, HIGH probability mean reversion - BEST SETUP
- Oversold + ADX > 40 = Strong trend! Could reverse OR continue. Higher risk.

### Overbought Combinations (BAD for longs)
- RSI > 70 + Stoch > 80 = Double overbought - HIGH pullback risk, AVOID longs
- RSI > 75 + Stoch > 90 = EXTREME overbought - reversal down likely

---

## CRITICAL: DOWNWARD INDICATORS DO NOT CANCEL OVERSOLD SIGNALS

When price is OVERSOLD (RSI < 30 or Stoch < 20):
- Negative MACD = explains WHY it's oversold (selling happened) - NOT a reason to avoid
- Downward Supertrend = confirms the down move occurred - NOT a reason to avoid
- Strong ADX = trend was powerful - does NOT mean it will continue forever

OVERSOLD + DOWNWARD INDICATORS = GOOD LONG SETUP
The downward indicators created the oversold condition. They are not additional negatives.

Example: Stoch = 5, MACD negative, Supertrend -1
- WRONG thinking: "Three downward signals, avoid!"
- RIGHT thinking: "Price crashed to the floor, sellers exhausted, bounce likely"

---

## OUR TRADING HISTORY (What worked for us)

MEMORY 1: "March 2020 - We bought BTC when RSI=25, Stoch=6, MACD was deeply negative. Everyone said 'don't catch falling knife' but we bought anyway. Price bounced +45% in 2 weeks. LESSON: Extreme oversold + negative momentum = BUY signal, not avoid signal."

MEMORY 2: "May 2021 - We bought ETH when Stoch=4, RSI=22, Supertrend was -1. The negative indicators EXPLAINED why it was oversold. We made +38% on that trade. LESSON: Stoch < 10 is a gift."

MEMORY 3: "Luna crash 2022 - We avoided buying SOL when RSI=72, Stoch=88. Good call - it dropped 60% after. LESSON: Overbought = stay away."

MEMORY 4: "November 2022 - RSI=50, Stoch=45, ADX=12. No clear signal. We skipped it. Correct - price went sideways. LESSON: Neutral = no edge, skip."

MEMORY 5: "January 2024 - Stoch dropped to 8, RSI=30, MACD histogram deeply negative. We hesitated because 'everything looks negative'. MISTAKE. Price bounced +25%. We missed it. LESSON LEARNED: Stop treating oversold + negative MACD as 'avoid'. The negative MACD is WHY it's oversold!"

Rate this trade setup using one of these labels:

SB = STRONG BUY - Stoch < 10 or RSI < 25. Extreme oversold. High probability winner.
B = BUY - RSI < 30 or Stoch < 20. Oversold conditions. Worth taking.
S = SKIP - Neutral conditions. No clear edge. Pass on this trade.
SS = STRONG SKIP - Overbought (RSI > 70, Stoch > 80). Avoid this trade.

- Stoch < 10 → We made money buying these. Choice = "SB".
- RSI < 30 → Oversold, we made money. Choice = "B" or "SB".
- RSI > 70 + Stoch > 80 → We lost money. Choice = "SS".

## Your Role
You entered a trade. Now you must decide at each candle: continue holding or exit now.

## Key Considerations
1. **Trend Health:** Is the trend that got you in still intact?
2. **Momentum Shift:** Are oscillators diverging from price?
3. **Profit Protection:** Have gains become significant enough to lock in?
4. **Risk Signals:** Are warning signs appearing?

## Exit Triggers to Watch
- Momentum divergence (price up, RSI down or vice versa)
- Trend indicator flip (Supertrend, MACD crossover)
- Extreme readings reversing (RSI leaving overbought/oversold)
- Bollinger band rejection
- Volume divergence
