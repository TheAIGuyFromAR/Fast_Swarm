INDICATOR_KNOWLEDGE = """## TECHNICAL INDICATOR REFERENCE

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)

Measures the ratio of recent upward price movements to total price movement.

Formula: RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + AvgGain/AvgLoss))

Range: 0-100
- 0-25: EXTREMELY oversold - sellers exhausted, strong bounce probability
- 25-30: Oversold - selling pressure dominated, potential reversal zone
- 30-70: Neutral - neither buyers nor sellers dominating
- 70-75: Overbought - buying pressure dominated, potential pullback zone
- 75-100: EXTREMELY overbought - buyers exhausted, correction likely

The period (7/14/21) controls sensitivity. RSI(14) is standard.

---

### Stochastic K

Measures where price closed relative to its recent high-low range.

Formula: %K = (Close - LowestLow) / (HighestHigh - LowestLow) * 100

Range: 0-100
- Stoch = 100: Price closed at the HIGH of recent range
- Stoch = 50: Price closed in the MIDDLE of recent range
- Stoch = 20: Price closed near the BOTTOM (20%) of range - oversold
- Stoch = 10: Price at bottom 10% of range - VERY oversold
- Stoch < 5: Price essentially at the FLOOR - EXTREMELY oversold, rare

CRITICAL: Stoch < 10 means price has collapsed to near the lowest point of recent trading.
This is often a capitulation/exhaustion signal, not just "oversold."

---

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

Measures the relationship between fast and slow exponential moving averages.

Components:
- MACD Line = EMA(12) - EMA(26)
- Signal Line = EMA(9) of MACD Line

Interpretation:
- MACD Line > 0: Short-term average above long-term (recent prices higher)
- MACD Line < 0: Short-term average below long-term (recent prices lower)
- MACD > Signal: Momentum accelerating upward (bullish crossover)
- MACD < Signal: Momentum accelerating downward (bearish crossover)

IMPORTANT: Bearish MACD during oversold conditions explains WHY price fell.
It is not an additional reason to avoid - the selling already happened.

---

### ADX (Average Directional Index)

Measures trend STRENGTH, NOT direction. ADX does not tell you up or down.

Range: 0-100
- 0-20: Weak or absent trend - ranging/choppy market
- 20-25: Trend developing
- 25-40: Moderate trend strength
- 40-60: Strong trend
- 60+: Very strong trend (rare)

CRITICAL: Low ADX (< 20) means RANGING market where mean reversion works well.
Oversold + Low ADX = HIGH probability of bounce back to mean.

---

### Supertrend

Trend direction indicator using ATR-based dynamic bands.

Values:
- Direction = +1: Indicator considers trend BULLISH
- Direction = -1: Indicator considers trend BEARISH
- Direction = 0: Neutral/undefined

IMPORTANT: Bearish Supertrend during oversold conditions shows the TREND that caused
the oversold state. It explains context, not an additional negative signal.

---

### ATR (Average True Range)

Measures average price movement per period, accounting for gaps.

Interpretation:
- Higher ATR = more volatile, larger price swings
- Lower ATR = calmer, smaller price swings
- ATR does NOT indicate direction

Used for: position sizing, stop-loss placement, volatility context.

---

### Bollinger Bands

Statistical bands showing where price "usually" trades.

Components:
- Middle = SMA(20)
- Upper = SMA(20) + 2 standard deviations
- Lower = SMA(20) - 2 standard deviations

Interpretation:
- Price at upper band: ~2 std dev above average (extended high)
- Price at lower band: ~2 std dev below average (extended low)
- Wide bands = high volatility period
- Narrow bands = low volatility period

---

### Fear & Greed Index

Aggregate market sentiment indicator (0-100).

Ranges:
- 0-25: EXTREME FEAR - investors very worried, panic selling
- 25-45: Fear - cautious sentiment
- 45-55: Neutral - balanced sentiment
- 55-75: Greed - optimistic sentiment
- 75-100: EXTREME GREED - euphoria, complacency

---

## INDICATOR COMBINATIONS (CRITICAL)

Single indicators mean little. Combinations tell the full story.

### Oversold Combinations (GOOD for longs)
- RSI < 30 + Stoch < 20 = Double oversold confirmation, strong reversal signal
- RSI < 25 + Stoch < 10 = EXTREME oversold / capitulation, very high bounce probability
- Stoch < 5 alone = Price at the floor, sellers completely exhausted

### Oversold + Trend Context
- Oversold + ADX < 20 = Dip in ranging market, HIGH probability mean reversion - BEST SETUP
- Oversold + ADX 20-40 = Moderate trend, decent reversal probability
- Oversold + ADX > 40 = Strong trend! Could reverse OR continue. Higher risk.

### Neutral Zone (No Strong Signal)
- RSI 35-65 + Stoch 25-75 = NEUTRAL range - no extremes
- Neutral indicators alone = uncertain, no clear setup

### Overbought Combinations (BAD for longs)
- RSI > 70 = Price extended high - pullback risk
- Stoch > 80 = Price near top of range - limited upside
- RSI > 70 + Stoch > 80 = Double overbought - HIGH pullback risk, AVOID longs
- RSI > 75 + Stoch > 90 = EXTREME overbought - reversal down likely

### Strong Trend Context
- ADX > 50 = VERY strong trend - higher risk trades
- Strong trend + Oversold = Could still reverse, but higher risk

### Sentiment Context
- Extreme Fear + Oversold = Panic capitulation, often marks bottoms - BULLISH
- Extreme Fear + NOT oversold = Market worried but price hasn't crashed - CAUTION
- Extreme Greed + Oversold = Dip in bull market - BULLISH
- Extreme Greed + Overbought = Euphoria/blow-off top - AVOID longs

### MACD Context
- Bearish MACD + Oversold = Momentum pushed it down, selling may be exhausted - OK
- Bearish MACD + NOT oversold = Momentum still down, more downside possible - CAUTION
- Bullish MACD crossover + Oversold = Momentum turning at lows - early reversal signal

---

## CRITICAL: BEARISH INDICATORS DO NOT CANCEL OVERSOLD SIGNALS

When price is OVERSOLD (RSI < 30 or Stoch < 20):
- Bearish MACD = explains WHY it's oversold (selling happened) - NOT a reason to avoid
- Bearish Supertrend = confirms the down move occurred - NOT a reason to avoid
- Strong ADX = trend was powerful - does NOT mean it will continue forever

OVERSOLD + BEARISH INDICATORS = GOOD LONG SETUP
The bearish indicators created the oversold condition. They are not additional negatives.

Example: Stoch = 5, MACD bearish, Supertrend bearish
- WRONG thinking: "Three bearish signals, avoid!"
- RIGHT thinking: "Price crashed to the floor, sellers exhausted, bounce likely"

## WHEN TO TRADE (Choice 1 or 2)
- Stoch < 10 = At the floor, STRONG signal regardless of other indicators
- RSI < 30 OR Stoch < 20 = Oversold, good entry
- Bearish MACD/Supertrend with oversold = CONFIRMS the setup, not a negative

## WHEN TO HOLD (Choice 3 or 4)
- RSI > 70 OR Stoch > 80 = Overbought, avoid longs
- RSI > 40 AND Stoch > 40 AND ADX > 50 = Strong trend continuation, risky
- No oversold signal present = no clear reversal setup

TASK_PROMPT = """## CONTEXT

You are a second opinion for a trading agent. The agent ALREADY matched a pattern and wants to enter.
Your job: Evaluate if THIS setup is worth taking, given the current indicator conditions.

The agent's pattern matching is the PRIMARY signal. You are checking if conditions support it.

## YOUR TASK

Rate this trade on a scale from -2 to +2:

+2 = BUY CONFIDENT
     Strong oversold signals. Stoch < 10 or RSI < 30. High probability winner.

+1 = BUY UNCERTAIN
     Decent setup. Worth taking but less certain.

-1 = SELL UNCERTAIN
     Leaning toward avoiding this trade.

-2 = SELL CONFIDENT
     Confident this is a BAD trade. Overbought, or no oversold signal present.

    "primary_signal": "the single most important indicator or combination",

CRITICAL REMINDER:
- Stoch < 10 = BUY (price at floor, sellers exhausted)
- Oversold + Bearish MACD/Supertrend = BUY (bearish indicators EXPLAIN the oversold, not cancel it)
- Do NOT say "oversold but bearish trend so avoid" - that is WRONG logic
- Choice 4 = CONFIDENT it will LOSE (overbought or no oversold signal), not "uncertain"
- If Stoch < 10 and you choose SELL, you are making a mistake"""
