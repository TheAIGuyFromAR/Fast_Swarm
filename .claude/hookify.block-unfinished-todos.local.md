**You have unfinished todos!**

You're trying to stop but there are still `pending` or `in_progress` tasks in your todo list.

Before stopping:
1. **Complete the remaining tasks** - Finish what you started
2. **Or mark them as completed** - If they're actually done
3. **Or remove them** - If they're no longer relevant

Don't leave work half-done. The user is counting on you to finish.
