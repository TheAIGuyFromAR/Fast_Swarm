**Significant code marker detected!**

You've added a TODO, FIXME, HACK, or deprecation marker. Consider capturing this in memory:

1. **What's the issue?** Document the problem being deferred
2. **Why not fix now?** Record the blocking reason
3. **What's the plan?** Note the intended resolution

Use `mcp__memory__add_observations` to add this to a relevant entity (or create one).

This helps future sessions understand pending work and technical debt.
